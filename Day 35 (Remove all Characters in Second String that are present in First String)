  public static void main(String args[])
  {
    //Try out your code here
    	Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
    	String s1 = sc.nextLine();
        String s2 = sc.nextLine();
        String result = removeCommonCharacters(s1, s2);
        System.out.println(result);
    }

    private static String removeCommonCharacters(String firstString, String secondString) {
        StringBuilder resultBuilder = new StringBuilder();
        boolean[] isCharPresent = new boolean[256];
        for (char c : firstString.toCharArray()) {
            isCharPresent[c] = true;
        }
        for (char c : secondString.toCharArray()) {
            if (!isCharPresent[c]) {
                resultBuilder.append(c);
            }
        }

        return resultBuilder.toString();
    }
}
