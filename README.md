**Welcome to the 100 Days of Code Challenge!**

Welcome to my 100 Days of Code challenge repository! This challenge is a personal commitment to code for at least an hour every day for the 100 days. During this challenge, I committed to coding for at least an hour every day for 100 days. It was a journey filled with learning and growth.

Happy coding!
