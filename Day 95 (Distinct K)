Problem Statement
You wish to help Ashish, who possesses a collection of N strings, some of which may be duplicated, and has been assigned the task of finding the kth unique string.

If the number of unique strings is less than k, he needs to display an empty string. Considering you are Ashish's best friend can you assist him with this challenge?

Input Format
The first line contains an integer N denoting the number of strings.
The next N lines contain strings.
The next line contains an integer k.
Output Format
The output contains the kth distinct string. If there are less than k unique string display an empty string.

Constraints
1<=N<=105
-1000000<=arr[i].length()<=1000000
Sample Testcase 0
Testcase Input
6
d
b
c
b
c
a
2
Testcase Output
a
Explanation
The only strings in arr that are distinct are "d" and "a." The letter "d" comes first, making it the first separate string.
Because "a" appears second, it is the second distinct string. "a" is returned since k == 2.

Sample Testcase 1
Testcase Input
3
dac
ba
a
1 
Testcase Output
dac
Explanation
As all the strings are unique we have the strings in the order:
1) dac
2) ba
3) a
Now, as we can see the value of k=1 therefore, the string returned is the 1st unique string = dac.
